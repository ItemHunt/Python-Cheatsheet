# Python Cheatsheet

## Introduction
The Python Cheatsheet repository is a place where you can view a cheatsheet for Python, a beginner friendly high-level interpreted general purpose programming language. You can also find useful pieces of information here (especially for beginners) and learning resources which are related to Python in one way or another. This repository is a mini-project for a much bigger project called the [*Learning-Hub Project*](https://github.com/ItemHunt/Learning-Hub). 

## How to Contribute
I welcome any contributors to this mini-project. Feel free to fork the project and add/edit stuff here and send out a pull request for review. If all is good, I should approve the pull request. In case you are new to GitHub, refer to [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for a more detailed guide.

## Libraries 


## Cheatsheet
### Modules
- **``from math import *`` -** *Math module*, Allows you to gain access to additional math functions

### Input and Output
- **``print ("Text")`` -** Outputs a string of characters
- **``variable_name = input("Text")`` -** Used to obtain user input, put it in a variable, and add text where you can ask the user for the input you want which is by default in string form

### Mathematical Operators
- **``+ (addition)`` -** operator for adding any form of values in things like variables, conditions, and print.
- **``- (subtraction)`` -** operator for subtracting values
- **``* (multiplication)`` -** operator for multiplying values
- **``/ (division)`` -** operator for dividing values
- **``() (parens)`` -** Used for creating groups in a mathematical problem
- **``% (remainder/mod operator)`` -** used to get the remainder of a problem after division
- **``= (assignment)`` -** used to assign a value to a variable
- **``< (less than)`` -** used for creating conditions
- **``> (greater than)`` -** used for creating conditions
- **``<= (less than or equal to)`` -** used for creating conditions
- **``>= (greater than or equal to)`` -** used for creating conditions
- **``== (equals)`` -** used to describe equal
- **``!= (not equal to)`` -** used for creating conditions
- **``operator=`` -** used as a shortcut to change the value of variables by using variables to interact with another variable. Examples of operator= are +=, -=, *=, and /=.

### Mathematical Functions
- **``int(variable_name)`` -** Converts a variable's numerical value into a integer value only
- **``float(variable_name)`` -** Converts a variable's numerical value into a float value (integers/decimal numbers)
- **``print (abs(variable_name))`` -** Converts number values to its absolute value equivalent and prints that value
- **``print (pow(base_number, exponent_number))`` -** Used to calculate for the power of a number and print it
- **``print (max(number1, number2))`` -** Used to select the largest number and print it
- **``print (min(number1, number2))`` -** Used to select the smallest number and print it
- **``print (round(number))`` -** Used to round off a number
- **``print (floor(number))`` -** Used to round down a number. Requires math module
- **``print (ceil(number))`` -** Used to round up a number. Requires math module
- **``print (sqrt(number))`` -** Used to get the squareroot of a number. Requires math module

### Very Useful Codes
- **``\n`` -** allows you to skip another line
- **``\*`` -** allows you to place quotations inside of print commands
- **``# Hello, I am a comment`` -** creates a comment line
- **``""" comment box """`` -** creates a comment box
- **``&&`` -** stands for 'and'
- **``||`` -** stands for 'or'

### Data Types
- **``variable_name = number_value`` -** used to create variables for any numbers (integers and decimals)
- **``variable_name = "string"`` -** used to create variables for strings. You can use *''* too instead of *""*
- **``variable_name = boolean_value`` -** used to create variables for boolean

### String Codes
- **``print (variable_name.upper())`` -** Converts all string variable values into uppercase characters
- **``print (variable_name.isupper())`` -** Returns the boolean value true if all characters in the variable are uppercase characters
- **``print (variable_name.lower())`` -** Converts all string variable values into lowercase characters
- **``print (variable_name.islower())`` -** Returns the boolean value true if all characters in the variable are lowercase characters
- **``print (len(variable_name))`` -** Returns the length of the string variable or the number of characters inside of the string variable.
- **``print (variable_name[index position])`` -** Returns the character present in the specified index position
- **``print (variable_name.index("character that belongs to the string"))`` -** Returns the index position of the specified character or the starting index position of the substring. 
- **``print (variable_name.replace("what you want to replace", "what you want to replace it with"))`` -**  Replaces the target part of the string variable with a input of your choice
- **``print (str(variable_name))`` -** Converts non-string variables into string variables

### Data Structures
- **``array_name = [element1, element2, elementN]`` -** Used to create an array which can contain many different variables

### Loops and Related Codes


### Conditions


### Functions


### Classes and Objects


### Other Codes


## Additional Information For Python
- String codes can be used in conjunction with each other. In other words, you can use multiple of them in the same print statement line. 
- By adding [number] next to a string variable or array, you can obtain a specific character or element which matches the number/index position
