# Guide to Contributing

## Notice
This guide is specifically made for those who are new to GitHub. If you are not new to GitHub, please refer to [How to Contribute](https://github.com/ItemHunt/C-plus-plus-Cheatsheet#how-to-contribute).

## How to Contribute Step-By-Step
1. Enter the ItemHunt/C-plus-plus-Cheatsheet repository
2. At the top right portion of your screen, you should see a button called "Fork" it is next to the star button.
3. Click on the fork button and create a forked repository. What this means is that you are getting a copy of the original repository for you to mess around with. None of your changes in your copy of the original repository will be seen in the main repository unless you make a pull request and I approve it for merging.
4. Enter the forked repository, forked repositories tend to have nearly the same name as the original except it has your username in the first portion, you van view this under "Your repositories" or "Repositories" in your profile and apply the changes you wanted to apply there
5. Once you are done applying changes to the forked repository, click on "Pull requests" then "New pull request" then create a pull request (Note that this step won't work if you haven't made any changes or your changes involve conflicting information)
6. Give your pull request a title and please provide a detailed description of the changes you made
7. Once step 6 is done, I should see your pull request. If I see anything wrong in it, I can provide feedback and deny the pull request. If its good, I can approve it and I can also provide feedback if I need to.
8. If your pull request was approved, then you should see your changes in the original repository and later be added in the list of contributors. If it was denied, you can always re-edit and make another pull requests

## Possible Concerns
### **How do I know if my forked repository is outdated? How do I update it?**
A message should pop out saying that your repository is behind the original one or well, behind in commits. You can update your repository to include all of the latest changes from the original repository by pressing the fetch button.
